## 🗂️ Scripts Included

### `broadcasting.py` 📡  
Multiple examples of how to apply broadcasting in NumPy to perform element-wise operations on arrays efficiently to solve problems.

### `diff.py` ➖  
An example of using the NumPy `diff()` function to determine whether a sequence is arithmetic.

### `ix.py` 🔘  
A demonstration of using the `ix_()` function to apply Boolean masking to both the rows and columns of an array.

### `logical.py` 🤖  
An example of using the `&` (and), `|` (or), and `~` (not) operators on NumPy arrays, as well as their equivalent functions `logical_and`, `logical_or`, and `logical_not`.

### `mask.py` 🎭  
Examples of NumPy array slicing and multidimensional Boolean masking.

### `ravel.py` 🌀  
A demonstration of the NumPy `ravel()` function, which flattens an array into one dimension.

### `size.py` 🔷  
Examples of using the NumPy `size()` and `shape()` functions to determine the dimensions of an array.

### `unique.py` 🔮  
An example of using the NumPy `unique()` function to gather data from an array, such as probabilities, frequencies, and the mode.

### `kinematics.py` 🏃  
An example of using the `diff()` function to find the maximum speed of a particle.
