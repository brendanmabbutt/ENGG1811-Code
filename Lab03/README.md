# Lab Materials – Week 3

Please find the following Python scripts for this week:

---

## 🗂️ Scripts Included

### `boolean.py` ❌✅  
Contains some example Boolean expressions that you can try copying into the console.

### `boolean_variable.py` 🔘  
An example of using the Boolean variable data type.  
> 💡 Note: The data type `boolean` should be included in the data dictionary for a Boolean variable.

### `grade.py` 🎓  
Contains the optimized `if`/`elif`/`else` university grading block discussed in the slides.

### `style.py` ✨  
A well-styled script for converting from degrees to radians and then shifting the resultant angle by a fixed amount.

### `input.py` ⌨️  
An example of using the `input()` function to categorize numbers into favorable or non-favorable groups.  
Also demonstrates how to format and comment an `if`/`elif`/`else` block effectively.

### `plot.py` 📉  
An example of how to plot in Python using the `matplotlib` library, which can be adapted for this week's exercises.

### `nested_if.py` 🐣  
An example of when using a nested `if` statement (an `if` inside another) is appropriate.  
> ✅ Where possible, try to use an `if`/`elif`/`else` block instead, as it's generally cleaner.

### `tax.py` 💸  
An example of plotting income tax based on tax brackets and income level.

### `sleep.py` 😴  
An example of classification based on how much sleep a person has had.
