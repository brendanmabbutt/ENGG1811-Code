## 🗂️ Scripts Included

### `zeros.py` 🏁  
An example of using the NumPy function `zeros()` to generate an array where all elements are set to a specific value.

### `zeros_like.py` 📝  
A demonstration of the `zeros_like()` function, which creates an array with the same shape as another array but filled with zeros.

### `where.py` 🧭  
An example of using the NumPy function `where()` to find the locations of specific values within an array, as well as how this can be used to efficiently edit an array.

### `min_max.py` 📊  
A demonstration of the NumPy functions `min()`, `argmin()`, `argmax()`, and `max()`, used in the context of finding maxima and minima in functions/graphs.

### `key_or_pos.py` 🔑📌  
A demonstration of the difference between keyword and positional arguments in NumPy functions, including how to use default values.

### `arange.py` ➰  
Examples of using the NumPy `arange()` function to generate arrays with evenly spaced values.

### `hit.py` 🏐  
An example of using NumPy to find the player with the shortest distance from the target in a game of beanbags.

### `spring.py` 🌱  
An example of applying Euler's forward method to Hooke's Law to compute the position and velocity of a spring over time.
