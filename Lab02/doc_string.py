Purpose: To calculate the average speed of a tennis ball
         during its flight.

Author:  Brendan Mabbutt

Date:    18/10/24

Method:  Define the distance and time variables. 
         Then calculate the speed by taking the quoteint of
         distance over time and assign it to speed.

Data dictionary:
    [float] distance    The distance in meters the tennis ball                       
                         has traveled during its time of flight
                         
     [int] time          The tennis ball's time of flight 
                         in seconds
                         
     [float] speed       The average speed of the tennis ball
                         while airborne in meters per second
